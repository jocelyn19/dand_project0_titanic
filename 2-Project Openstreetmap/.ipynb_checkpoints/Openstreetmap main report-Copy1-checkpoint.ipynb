    "1. Benefits: the same database could be used by many apps to show on a map different informations. This would bring more users to visit openstreetmap and use the platform.\n",
    "2. Anticipated problems: of courses, this would imply a good moderator system, not to publish incorrect data and make sure that the comments are fair for example, that the picture are the one showing the restaurant... and on top, the size of the database (one extract of an area is generally over 1 Go) would go through the roof, implying more cost for openstreetmap.\n",
    "   \n",
    "Another idea could be to implement a layer, on top of the map, that shows with different colors the level of completeness of the map, helping willing users to work on the porrly documented areas first. For the area I analysed with coordinate between -3,99272 and -3,72681 (middle point being -3,834) and 47,7684 and 47,94464 (middle point 47,85), I could divide the area in 4 squares and count per squares the number of nodes.\n",
    "1. Benefits: it would make it easy for users willing to help to give priority on areas with less data first, and ensure that the maps are in average well documented\n",
    "2. Anticipated problems: some areas (country side) don't have a lot to show compared to cities where a lot of information is available. So the color system would not really represent the degree of completeness of each areas.  "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "The area audited, cleaned and analysed, showed a very good level of data integrity. Very few mistakes were found. One easy improvment on openstreetmap side, would be to automatically tranform the first letter of a street name to an upper case. This project allowed me to learn a new database language (MongoDB) which is completly different from SQL, but allowing to store data in a much more flexible way, although it can become very messy, very quickly, if no standards are followed.\n",
