Here is the list of references I used to complete the project:
- All python scripts used to audit, clean and analyse the data come from the case study provided in the previous lesson
- The mongoDB queries were built using https://docs.mongodb.com
- Queries were executed using Mongoboost software
- For debugging and examples:
	- python : https://www.python.org/doc/
	- stackoverflow.com for all bugs and errors
	- google in general as a starting point
